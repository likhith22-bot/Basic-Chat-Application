## Task 8: Build a Chatbot using if-else

### Objective:
Create a simple rule-based chatbot using Python.

### Tools:
- Python 3.x

### Deliverables:
- A Python script (`chatbot.py`) that simulates a conversation with a user.

### Hints:
1. Use a while loop for continuous interaction.
2. Use `input()` for user responses and `print()` for chatbot replies.
3. Implement logic using if-elif-else conditions.
4. Normalize inputs using `.lower()` or `.strip()` to handle different cases.

### Example Output:
Hello! I'm ChatBot. Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hi
ChatBot: Hello there! How can I help you today?
You: why your are here
ChatBot: Sorry, I didn't understand that.
You: tell me a joke
ChatBot: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!
You: what's your purpose
ChatBot: I'm here to assist you and make your day a little brighter!
You: how are you
ChatBot: I'm just a bunch of code, but I'm functioning as expected!
You: bye
ChatBot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
